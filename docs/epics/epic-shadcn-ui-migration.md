# Complete shadcn/ui Migration with New Design System - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Complete the migration to shadcn/ui component library throughout the EAS React application, establishing a consistent design system with improved theme support and enhanced component standardization to improve development velocity and user experience consistency.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: EAS React frontend with partial shadcn/ui implementation, TailwindCSS styling, and theme-aware components already in place
- Technology stack: React 18, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui (partially implemented), Lucide React icons
- Integration points: All existing components, layouts, forms, and UI elements throughout the application

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Complete migration of all remaining UI components to shadcn/ui, standardize theme implementation, establish comprehensive design system with consistent patterns
- How it integrates: Replace existing custom components with shadcn/ui equivalents while maintaining all current functionality and improving theme consistency
- Success criteria: 100% shadcn/ui component usage, consistent theme behavior across all components, improved development experience with standardized component patterns

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Audit and Catalog Existing Components - Identify all current custom components and map them to shadcn/ui equivalents, documenting integration requirements and compatibility needs

2. **Story 2:** Migrate Core Components and Layout System - Replace all layout components (headers, sidebars, cards, buttons) with shadcn/ui equivalents while maintaining existing functionality and theme behavior

3. **Story 3:** Migrate Forms and Data Components - Convert all form components, data tables, and complex UI elements to shadcn/ui variants, ensuring form validation and data handling remain intact

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no backend changes needed)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (enhanced patterns)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (potentially improved)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing component functionality during migration
- **Mitigation:** Incremental migration with component-by-component testing, maintaining existing CSS classes as fallbacks during transition
- **Rollback Plan:** Keep existing components in place until shadcn/ui equivalents are fully tested, use Git branches for safe rollback

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [x] Integration points working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately
- [x] No regression in existing features
- [x] Design system documentation created
- [x] Theme consistency validated across all components
- [x] Development guidelines established for future component additions
