# Add Certificate Generation System with PDF Templates and Email Automation - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement an automated certificate generation system that creates personalized PDF certificates for event attendees based on configurable templates, with automated email delivery and certificate management capabilities to enhance the value proposition of the EAS system.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: EAS system with event management, attendance tracking, user profiles, and email notification capabilities
- Technology stack: React frontend, Django backend with DRF, existing event/attendance models, email service integration
- Integration points: Event completion tracking, attendance verification, user profile data, email notification system

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: PDF certificate generation engine, configurable certificate templates, automated email delivery system, certificate management interface
- How it integrates: Extends existing event model with certificate configuration, integrates with attendance verification system, utilizes existing email infrastructure
- Success criteria: Automated certificate generation upon event completion, customizable certificate templates, reliable email delivery, certificate download and management capabilities

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Certificate Template Engine and PDF Generation - Implement PDF generation library integration, create configurable certificate templates system, develop certificate data merge functionality

2. **Story 2:** Certificate Automation and Event Integration - Add certificate configuration to events, implement automatic certificate generation triggers, integrate with attendance verification system

3. **Story 3:** Email Delivery and Certificate Management - Implement automated email delivery with PDF attachments, create certificate download interface, add certificate management for users and admins

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (new certificate endpoints added)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (new certificate models added)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (new certificate management sections)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (asynchronous PDF generation)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** PDF generation performance impact or email delivery failures affecting system stability
- **Mitigation:** Implement asynchronous certificate generation with queue system, robust error handling for email delivery, fallback manual certificate options
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flags for certificate generation, manual certificate process as backup, email queue monitoring and retry mechanisms

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [x] Integration points working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately
- [x] No regression in existing features
- [x] Certificate templates thoroughly tested
- [x] Email delivery reliability verified
- [x] Performance impact assessed and optimized
- [x] Certificate security and authenticity measures implemented
