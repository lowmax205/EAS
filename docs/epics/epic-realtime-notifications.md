# Implement Real-time Notifications with WebSocket Integration - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement a comprehensive real-time notification system using WebSocket technology to provide instant updates for event changes, attendance confirmations, and system alerts, significantly improving user engagement and system responsiveness.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: EAS system with event management, attendance tracking, existing email notification system
- Technology stack: React frontend, Django backend with DRF, existing notification models and email infrastructure
- Integration points: Event management system, attendance tracking, user authentication, existing notification preferences

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: WebSocket server implementation, real-time notification delivery, push notification interface, enhanced notification management system
- How it integrates: Extends existing notification system with real-time capabilities, integrates with all event and attendance operations, enhances user experience with instant updates
- Success criteria: Real-time event notifications, instant attendance confirmations, live system alerts, improved user engagement metrics

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** WebSocket Infrastructure and Connection Management - Implement WebSocket server, establish connection handling, create authentication integration for secure real-time connections

2. **Story 2:** Real-time Event and Attendance Notifications - Integrate WebSocket notifications with event changes, implement live attendance confirmations, add real-time event reminders and updates

3. **Story 3:** Notification Management and User Interface - Create real-time notification display components, implement notification preferences for real-time alerts, add notification history and management interface

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (WebSocket endpoints added separately)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (notification enhancement tables)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (enhanced with real-time components)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (efficient WebSocket implementation)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** WebSocket connection stability affecting user experience or server performance
- **Mitigation:** Implement robust connection recovery mechanisms, connection pooling and scaling strategies, fallback to traditional notifications
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flags for WebSocket functionality, graceful degradation to existing notification system, connection monitoring and auto-recovery

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [x] Integration points working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately
- [x] No regression in existing features
- [x] WebSocket connection stability verified
- [x] Real-time notification delivery tested across devices
- [x] Performance impact assessed and optimized
- [x] Scalability and connection limits established
