# Add Multi-Campus Support with Isolation and Reporting - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement comprehensive multi-campus support with proper data isolation, campus-specific reporting, and administrative controls to enable the EAS system to serve multiple university campuses while maintaining security and data separation.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Single-campus EAS system with attendance tracking, event management, and basic reporting capabilities
- Technology stack: React frontend, Django backend with DRF, existing user/event/attendance models
- Integration points: User authentication, event management, attendance tracking, reporting system, admin dashboard

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Campus-based user assignment, data isolation at database level, campus-specific event visibility, multi-campus reporting and analytics
- How it integrates: Extends existing models with campus relationships, adds campus-aware filtering throughout application, enhances admin controls for multi-campus management
- Success criteria: Complete data isolation between campuses, campus-specific admin controls, accurate multi-campus reporting, seamless user experience within assigned campus

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Implement Campus Data Model and User Assignment - Create campus entity, modify user model to include campus assignment, implement campus-based data filtering at API level

2. **Story 2:** Campus-Aware Event and Attendance Management - Modify event creation to be campus-specific, implement campus-based attendance tracking, ensure data isolation in all CRUD operations

3. **Story 3:** Multi-Campus Reporting and Admin Controls - Create campus-specific reporting views, implement cross-campus analytics for super-admins, add campus management interface for system administrators

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (enhanced with campus filtering)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (migration strategy included)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (enhanced with campus context)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (optimized queries with campus indexing)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Data leakage between campuses or breaking existing single-campus functionality
- **Mitigation:** Implement campus filtering at ORM level, extensive testing of data isolation, gradual rollout with campus assignment migration
- **Rollback Plan:** Database migration rollback scripts prepared, feature flags for campus-aware functionality, fallback to single-campus mode

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [x] Integration points working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately
- [x] No regression in existing features
- [x] Data isolation thoroughly tested and verified
- [x] Campus migration scripts tested and documented
- [x] Multi-campus admin training materials created
- [x] Performance impact assessed and optimized

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** Large (4-6 weeks)  
**Dependencies:** Database migration planning, admin user training  
**Team:** Full-stack Development Team, Database Administrator
