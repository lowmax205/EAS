- **Animation Performance:** 60fps on mobile devices, 120fps on high-refresh displays
- **Bundle Size:** < 1MB initial JavaScript bundle

### Responsive Performance Strategies

**Mobile-First Optimization:**
- Critical CSS inlined for above-the-fold content
- Progressive image loading with WebP format
- Component-level code splitting for route-based loading
- Service worker caching for offline functionality

**Progressive Enhancement:**
- Base functionality works without JavaScript
- Enhanced features load progressively
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Campus-specific assets loaded on demand

**Resource Loading Strategy:**
- **Mobile:** Essential resources only, lazy load secondary features
- **Tablet:** Moderate resource loading with prefetching
- **Desktop:** Full resource loading with aggressive caching
- **Wide:** Preload campus data for quick switching
