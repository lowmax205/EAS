## Conclusion

The existing project documentation provides an excellent foundation for multi-campus functionality but requires significant enhancement to meet the specific panel defense requirements. The core architecture is sound and well-designed, but approximately **40% of the panel-mandated features** are not currently addressed in the existing stories.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Rapid Integration**: Panel requirements can be integrated within existing architecture
2. **Technical Alignment**: No conflicts between thesis requirements and existing design
3. **Clear Priorities**: Must Have features are well-defined and achievable
4. **Scalable Foundation**: Existing multi-campus design supports all enhancement requirements

**Critical Path Forward:**
The project should prioritize panel-specific requirements as Must Have features while leveraging the excellent existing foundation for multi-campus support. The integration will strengthen rather than complicate the current architecture.
