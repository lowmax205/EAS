## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### **Story Implementation Process**
1. **Read Complete Story**: Review acceptance criteria, technical specs, and test requirements
2. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite stories are completed
3. **Follow Architecture**: Reference [Architecture Documentation](../architecture/) for technical patterns
4. **Implement with Tests**: Include unit, integration, and E2E tests as specified
5. **Update Documentation**: Maintain consistency with existing patterns

### **Acceptance Criteria Standards**
- **Functional**: Clear business logic and user interaction requirements
- **Technical**: API specifications, database constraints, and integration requirements
- **Testing**: Unit test coverage, integration test scenarios, and E2E test cases
- **Performance**: Response time requirements and scalability considerations

### **Definition of Done**
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met and verified
- ✅ Unit tests written and passing (>90% coverage)
- ✅ Integration tests implemented and passing
- ✅ E2E tests covering critical user paths
- ✅ Code review completed and approved
- ✅ Documentation updated (if applicable)
- ✅ Performance requirements verified
- ✅ Security requirements validated

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Campus Isolation Testing**
Every story must include tests that verify:
- Complete data isolation between campuses
- Proper campus-based access control
- Correct campus context in all operations
- Prevention of cross-campus data leakage

### **Integration Testing**
Each story includes:
- API endpoint testing with campus context
- Database constraint verification
- Frontend component testing with campus state
- End-to-end user workflow validation

### **Performance Testing**
Critical paths must maintain:
- < 2 second response times for campus-filtered operations
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Scalable architecture supporting unlimited campuses
- Memory and resource usage within acceptable limits
