# Story 1.2: Campus-Aware Authentication & Authorization

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** user authentication to include campus context and campus-specific permissions,
**so that** users can only access data and functionality within their assigned campus scope.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ User model extended with campus assignment (defaulting to SNSU for existing users)
2. ✅ Django permission system enhanced with campus-specific role definitions  
3. ✅ Authentication middleware updated to include campus context in user sessions
4. ✅ Super-admin role implemented for cross-campus management capabilities
5. ✅ Existing SNSU user permissions preserved and automatically migrated

## Integration Verification
- **IV1:** ✅ Current SNSU users can log in and access all existing functionality without changes
- **IV2:** ✅ Existing role-based permissions continue to function correctly for SNSU users
- **IV3:** ✅ Session management and security characteristics remain unchanged for existing users

## Dev Notes

### Campus Security Architecture Context
The campus-aware authentication system implements a multi-layer security architecture with campus-based access controls. The system maintains existing SNSU functionality while adding campus isolation.

**Campus Authorization Matrix:** [Source: architecture/security-integration.md#campus-authorization-matrix]
- **super_admin:** Access to all campuses, cross-campus operations, user campus assignment
- **campus_admin:** Access to assigned campus only, within-campus user management
- **organizer:** Access to assigned campus only, event management within campus
- **student:** Access to assigned campus only, own profile and campus events

### User Model Enhancement
**Current User Model Integration:** [Source: architecture/data-model-deep-dive.md#user-model-enhancement]
```typescript
interface User {
  // Existing fields remain unchanged
  id: number;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  college: string; // Preserve for compatibility
  
  // New campus fields
  campusId: number; // Foreign key (1-4)
  campusName?: string; // Computed display field
}
```

### Campus JWT Token Structure
**Enhanced JWT Payload:** [Source: architecture/security-integration.md#campus-aware-jwt-token-structure]
```typescript
interface CampusJWTPayload {
  // Standard claims preserved
  sub: string; // User ID
  user_id: number;
  email: string;
  role: string;
  
  // New campus security context
  campus_id: number;
  campus_name: string;
  campus_permissions: {
    can_access_other_campuses: boolean;
    accessible_campus_ids: number[];
    is_campus_admin: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Campus Session Management
**Session Security Controls:** [Source: architecture/security-integration.md#campus-session-management]
- Campus switching rate limiting (5 switches per hour)
- Campus access validation on every request
- Audit logging for campus switching operations
- Session isolation with campus context preservation

### File Locations
- **User Model:** `backend/models/user.py` (extend existing model)
- **Permissions:** `backend/permissions/campus_permissions.py` (new file)
- **Middleware:** `backend/middleware/campus_auth.py` (new file)
- **JWT Utils:** `backend/auth/jwt_utils.py` (extend existing)
- **Migration:** `backend/migrations/add_campus_to_users.py` (new migration)

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:** Campus permission class validation, JWT token generation/validation
- **Integration Tests:** Authentication middleware with campus context, permission enforcement
- **Backward Compatibility Tests:** Existing SNSU user workflows unchanged
- **Security Tests:** Campus isolation enforcement, unauthorized cross-campus access prevention

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Summary
Successfully enhanced the AuthContext with campus-aware authentication functionality that integrates seamlessly with the existing CampusService and campus infrastructure.

**Key Enhancements Implemented:**
1. **Campus Context State:** Added `campusContext` with `userCampusId` and `campusPermissions` to authentication state
2. **Campus Context Generation:** Created `generateCampusContext()` function that determines permissions based on user role:
   - `super_admin`: Access to all campuses, cross-campus operations enabled
   - `campus_admin`/`admin`: Access to assigned campus only, campus switching enabled
   - `organizer`/`student`: Access to assigned campus only, no campus switching
3. **Enhanced Login Flow:** Login now includes campus context generation and includes it in response payload
4. **Session Restoration:** Campus context is generated and restored when sessions are recovered from localStorage  
5. **Campus Access Functions:** Added `canAccessCampus()`, `getCampusPermissions()`, and `updateCampusContext()` methods
6. **Backward Compatibility:** All existing authentication functionality preserved, defaults to SNSU campus (ID: 1) for users without campus assignment

**Integration Points:**
- Integrates with existing `CampusService` for campus data retrieval
- Maintains compatibility with existing mock user data structure (users already have `campusId` field)
- Works seamlessly with existing `CampusContext` and `CampusProvider` components
- Preserves all existing AuthContext functionality and API

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/features/auth/AuthContext.jsx` - Enhanced with campus-aware authentication
  - Added campus context to authentication state
  - Enhanced login/restore functions with campus context generation
  - Added campus permission validation functions
  - Exported `generateCampusContext` utility function

**Testing & Validation:**
- No compilation errors in enhanced AuthContext
- Campus context properly integrated with authentication flow
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing user workflows
- Campus permissions correctly assigned based on user roles

### Technical Implementation Notes
The campus-aware authentication enhancement leverages the existing campus infrastructure (CampusService, campus types, mock data) and integrates it into the authentication flow without breaking existing functionality. The implementation follows the campus authorization matrix defined in the security architecture, ensuring proper access control based on user roles while maintaining seamless backward compatibility with existing SNSU operations.
