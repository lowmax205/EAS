# Story 2.1: Real-Time Analytics & Dashboard Enhancement

**Epic:** Panel Defense Compliance Enhancement  
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Ready for Implementation  
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** 13 Story Points  
**Sprint:** 6-7  

## Story Statement

As a **system administrator and event organizer**, I want **real-time analytics visualization with live dashboard updates and pattern analysis** so that **I can monitor attendance trends in real-time, detect unusual patterns, and provide immediate insights during events as required by the thesis panel**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Real-Time Histogram Visualization
- [ ] **GIVEN** an active event with attendees checking in
- [ ] **WHEN** I view the analytics dashboard
- [ ] **THEN** I should see a real-time histogram showing check-in patterns by time intervals
- [ ] **AND** the histogram should update immediately when new check-ins occur
- [ ] **AND** the visualization should be campus-specific based on my role and permissions

### AC2: Live Dashboard Refresh System
- [ ] **GIVEN** multiple users viewing the dashboard simultaneously
- [ ] **WHEN** attendance data changes (new check-ins, updates, corrections)
- [ ] **THEN** all dashboard instances should refresh automatically within 2 seconds
- [ ] **AND** updates should be campus-aware (users only see their campus data)
- [ ] **AND** the system should gracefully handle connection interruptions

### AC3: Check-In Pattern Analysis
- [ ] **GIVEN** historical and real-time attendance data
- [ ] **WHEN** I access the pattern analysis section
- [ ] **THEN** I should see trend analysis showing peak check-in times
- [ ] **AND** pattern comparison with previous similar events
- [ ] **AND** predictive indicators for expected attendance completion

### AC4: Unusual Activity Detection
- [ ] **GIVEN** normal attendance patterns for an event type
- [ ] **WHEN** unusual activity occurs (mass check-ins, geographic anomalies, duplicate attempts)
- [ ] **THEN** the system should highlight unusual patterns with visual indicators
- [ ] **AND** provide alerts for significant deviations from expected patterns
- [ ] **AND** allow administrators to investigate flagged activities

### AC5: Campus-Specific Real-Time Analytics
- [ ] **GIVEN** a multi-campus system with real-time data
- [ ] **WHEN** I access analytics as a campus-specific administrator
- [ ] **THEN** I should only see real-time data for my assigned campus
- [ ] **AND** super-administrators should see aggregated real-time data across campuses
- [ ] **AND** campus data isolation should be maintained in real-time streams

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds on the foundation established in Story 1.6 (Campus-Specific Reporting & Analytics) and extends it with real-time capabilities. Key insights from previous implementation:
- Campus data isolation patterns are established and should be maintained
- Existing analytics infrastructure can be enhanced rather than replaced
- Performance considerations for campus-filtered queries are already addressed

### Real-Time Infrastructure Requirements
**WebSocket Integration Requirements:**
- Implement WebSocket server for real-time data streaming
- Use Socket.IO or native WebSocket with connection pooling
- Maintain campus-aware channels for data isolation
- Implement reconnection logic for reliability

**Performance Considerations:**
- Real-time updates should not impact existing system performance
- Implement data throttling for high-frequency events
- Use efficient data serialization for WebSocket messages
- Consider Redis for real-time data caching

### Dashboard Architecture
**Component Structure:**
```typescript
components/analytics/
â”œâ”€â”€ RealTimeHistogram.tsx        // Primary histogram visualization
â”œâ”€â”€ LiveDashboard.tsx           // Main dashboard container
â”œâ”€â”€ PatternAnalysis.tsx         // Trend and pattern components
â”œâ”€â”€ UnusualActivityAlert.tsx    // Alert and notification system
â””â”€â”€ RealTimeMetrics.tsx         // Key performance indicators
```

**Data Flow Architecture:**
```
Event Check-in â†’ WebSocket Emit â†’ Campus Filter â†’ Dashboard Update â†’ UI Refresh
```

### API Specifications
**New Real-Time Endpoints:**
```typescript
// WebSocket Events
socket.on('attendance:update', (data: AttendanceUpdate) => void)
socket.on('pattern:unusual', (alert: UnusualActivityAlert) => void)
socket.on('dashboard:refresh', (metrics: DashboardMetrics) => void)

// REST API Extensions
GET /api/analytics/real-time/histogram/{eventId}
GET /api/analytics/patterns/{eventId}
GET /api/analytics/unusual-activity/{campusId}
```

### Component Specifications
**RealTimeHistogram Component:**
```typescript
interface RealTimeHistogramProps {
  eventId: string;
  campusId: string;
  updateInterval: number; // milliseconds
  timeGranularity: 'minute' | 'hour'; // histogram bucket size
}
```

**LiveDashboard Component:**
```typescript
interface LiveDashboardState {
  connectionStatus: 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'reconnecting';
  lastUpdate: Date;
  metrics: DashboardMetrics;
  alerts: UnusualActivityAlert[];
}
```

### Data Models
**Real-Time Analytics Schema:**
```sql
-- Extends existing attendance tracking
CREATE TABLE real_time_analytics (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
    campus_id UUID REFERENCES campuses(id),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    check_in_count INTEGER,
    pattern_type VARCHAR(50),
    anomaly_score FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Unusual activity tracking
CREATE TABLE unusual_activity_alerts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    campus_id UUID REFERENCES campuses(id),
    event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
    alert_type VARCHAR(100),
    severity VARCHAR(20),
    description TEXT,
    resolved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Testing Requirements
**Real-Time Testing Strategy:**
- WebSocket connection and disconnection testing
- Campus data isolation in real-time streams
- Performance testing with high-frequency updates
- Cross-browser compatibility for WebSocket features
- Load testing for multiple concurrent dashboard users

**Test Scenarios:**
```typescript
// WebSocket connection testing
describe('Real-Time Dashboard', () => {
  test('maintains campus isolation in real-time updates')
  test('handles connection interruptions gracefully')
  test('throttles high-frequency updates appropriately')
  test('displays accurate histogram data in real-time')
})
```

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Requirements:**
- Dashboard updates must occur within 2 seconds of data changes
- System must support 50+ concurrent real-time dashboard users per campus
- Memory usage for WebSocket connections must not exceed 100MB per campus
- Database queries for real-time data must execute under 500ms

**Security Considerations:**
- WebSocket authentication using existing campus-aware JWT tokens
- Rate limiting for WebSocket connections (10 connections per user)
- Campus data validation in all real-time data streams
- Audit logging for unusual activity alerts

- `src/features/analytics/api/realTimeEndpoints.ts`
- `src/features/analytics/types/realTimeTypes.ts`

### Campus Context Integration
**Campus-Aware Real-Time Data:**
All real-time analytics must maintain existing campus isolation patterns:
- WebSocket channels are campus-specific
- Real-time queries include campus filtering
- Dashboard components use campus context from existing providers
- Alert systems respect campus administrative boundaries

### Integration Points
**Existing System Integration:**
- Extends analytics infrastructure from Story 1.6
- Uses campus context from existing authentication (Story 1.2)
- Integrates with event management from existing system
- Builds on existing performance optimization patterns

**Future Story Preparation:**
- Provides real-time infrastructure for Story 2.2 (immediate feedback)
- Enables enhanced reporting capabilities for Story 2.3
- Creates foundation for certificate generation real-time updates
