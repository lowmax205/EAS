# Story 1.7: Multi-Campus System Administration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** super administrator,
**I want** comprehensive tools to manage multiple campuses and monitor system-wide operations,
**so that** I can efficiently administer the multi-campus system while maintaining operational excellence.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Campus CRUD operations interface with configuration management capabilities
2. Cross-campus user management with campus assignment and transfer capabilities
3. System-wide monitoring dashboard with campus-specific health indicators
4. Multi-campus configuration management with campus-specific customization options
5. Audit logging and compliance reporting across all campus operations

## Integration Verification
- **IV1:** Single-campus administration functions remain available and unchanged
- **IV2:** System performance monitoring continues to provide accurate metrics for existing operations
- **IV3:** Administrative workflows for SNSU operations remain streamlined and efficient

  - [ ] Add campus activity monitoring and suspicious behavior detection
  - [ ] Build data retention and privacy compliance tools

## Dev Notes

### Super-Admin Security Context
The super-admin role requires the highest level of security and audit logging, with access to all campuses and system-wide operations.

**Super-Admin Authorization:** [Source: architecture/security-integration.md#campus-authorization-matrix]
```typescript
super_admin: {
  campus_access: "all";
  cross_campus_operations: true;
  user_campus_assignment: true;
  system_configuration: true;
  audit_access: true;
  compliance_reporting: true;
}
```

### Campus Management Data Models
**Campus Configuration Model:**
```typescript
interface CampusConfiguration {
  campusId: number;
  displayName: string;
  campusCode: string;
  domain: string;
  timezone: string;
  locale: string;
  branding: {
    primaryColor: string;
    secondaryColor: string;
    logoUrl?: string;
    faviconUrl?: string;
  };
  features: {
    multiCampusMode: boolean;
    certificateGeneration: boolean;
    realtimeNotifications: boolean;
  };
  limits: {
    maxUsers: number;
    maxEvents: number;
    storageQuota: string;
  };
}
```

### Cross-Campus User Management
**User Campus Transfer Model:**
```typescript
interface CampusTransferRequest {
  userId: number;
  fromCampusId: number;
  toCampusId: number;
  transferReason: string;
  preserveRole: boolean;
  preserveEventHistory: boolean;
  requestedBy: number;
  approvedBy?: number;
  transferDate?: Date;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'completed';
}
```

### System Monitoring Architecture
**Campus Health Metrics:**
```typescript
interface CampusHealthMetrics {
  campusId: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  userMetrics: {
    totalUsers: number;
    activeUsers24h: number;
    activeUsers7d: number;
    newRegistrations7d: number;
  };
  eventMetrics: {
    totalEvents: number;
    activeEvents: number;
    eventsCreated7d: number;
    attendanceRate7d: number;
  };
  systemMetrics: {
    apiResponseTime: number;
    errorRate24h: number;
    databaseQueryTime: number;
    storageUsage: number;
  };
  alertLevel: 'healthy' | 'warning' | 'critical';
}
```

### Audit Logging Framework
**Comprehensive Audit Trail:**
```typescript
interface AuditLogEntry {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: number;
  campusId: number;
  action: string;
  resource: string;
  resourceId?: string;
  changes?: {
    before: any;
    after: any;
  };
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  outcome: 'success' | 'failure' | 'error';
  errorMessage?: string;
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
}
```

### File Locations
- **Campus Admin Dashboard:** `frontend/src/pages/admin/CampusAdministration.jsx` (new file)
- **Campus CRUD:** `frontend/src/components/admin/CampusManagement.jsx` (new file)
- **User Transfer:** `frontend/src/components/admin/UserCampusTransfer.jsx` (new file)
- **System Monitoring:** `frontend/src/components/admin/SystemMonitoring.jsx` (new file)
- **Audit Logging:** `backend/services/audit_service.py` (new file)
- **Campus Config:** `backend/models/campus_config.py` (new file)
- **Health Metrics:** `backend/services/health_metrics.py` (new file)

### Security Considerations
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Required for all super-admin operations
- **IP Whitelisting:** Super-admin access restricted to approved IP ranges
- **Session Timeout:** Shorter session timeouts for administrative functions
- **Audit Trail:** Every action logged with detailed context and user information
- **Role Separation:** Clear separation between campus admin and super-admin roles

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:** Campus CRUD operations, user transfer workflows, health metric calculations
- **Integration Tests:** Cross-campus operations, audit logging, compliance reporting
- **Security Tests:** Super-admin privilege escalation prevention, audit log tampering protection
- **Performance Tests:** System monitoring dashboard with multiple campuses
- **Compliance Tests:** Data retention policies, audit trail completeness
