# Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with rationale

Based on my analysis of your existing project, this enhancement should be structured as **a single comprehensive epic** because:

**Rationale for Single Epic Approach:**
- **Cohesive Feature Set:** Multi-campus support represents one logical enhancement that touches multiple system layers but delivers a unified capability
- **Interdependent Components:** Campus management, data isolation, user management, and UI changes are tightly coupled and should be developed together
- **Risk Management:** A single epic allows for coordinated testing and rollout of all multi-campus components simultaneously
- **Existing Architecture Integration:** Your current architecture documentation treats multi-campus as a unified enhancement, not separate features
