- Backend: Django (planned/in development)
- Testing: Vitest (inferred from Vite setup)

**Database**: 
- PostgreSQL (inferred from Django best practices and multi-tenant requirements)
- Potential Redis for session management and caching

**Infrastructure**: 
- Current: Static hosting (easuniversity.site)
- Planned: Django deployment infrastructure
- Build: Vite development and production builds

**External Dependencies**: 
- Mapbox API for location/GPS verification
- Email services for user verification
- QR code generation libraries

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: 
- **Schema Extension**: Add Campus entity as a new table with foreign key relationships to existing User, Event, and related tables
- **Data Migration**: Implement Django migrations to add campus context to existing data, with SNSU as default campus
- **Query Optimization**: Add database indexes for campus-based filtering and implement tenant-aware queries
- **Data Isolation**: Enforce campus-based row-level security through Django ORM and database constraints

**API Integration Strategy**: 
- **Backward Compatibility**: Extend existing API endpoints with optional campus filtering while maintaining current functionality
- **Authentication Enhancement**: Extend Django REST framework authentication to include campus context in user sessions
- **Permission Framework**: Implement campus-aware permissions extending Django's existing permission system
- **API Versioning**: Use header-based versioning to support both single-campus and multi-campus API clients

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: 
- **Context Providers**: Implement React Context for campus state management alongside existing authentication context
- **Component Enhancement**: Extend existing components with campus-aware props and filtering capabilities
- **Routing Integration**: Enhance existing React Router setup with campus context without breaking current routes
- **State Management**: Integrate campus state with existing state management patterns (likely React state + Context)

**Testing Integration Strategy**: 
- **Test Data**: Create comprehensive test fixtures with multi-campus scenarios
- **Component Testing**: Extend existing component tests to cover campus-aware functionality
- **Integration Testing**: Add API endpoint tests for campus isolation and permission verification
- **E2E Testing**: Implement user journey tests covering both single-campus and multi-campus workflows

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
- **Feature-based Organization**: Extend existing `/src/features/` structure with campus-related features
- **Shared Components**: Add campus-aware components to `/src/components/common/` and `/src/components/ui/`
- **Service Layer**: Create `/src/services/campusService.js` following existing service patterns
- **Utility Functions**: Add campus utilities to `/src/lib/utils.js` following existing patterns

**Naming Conventions**: 
- **Components**: Follow existing PascalCase for React components (e.g., `CampusSelector`, `CampusAwareDataTable`)
- **Files**: Follow existing camelCase for JavaScript files (e.g., `campusService.js`, `campusUtils.js`)
- **API Endpoints**: Follow REST conventions with campus context (e.g., `/api/campuses/`, `/api/events/?campus_id=`)
- **Database**: Follow Django conventions with campus_ prefix for new fields

**Coding Standards**: 
- **React Patterns**: Continue using functional components with hooks, following existing component structure
- **Import Organization**: Follow existing import ordering (React, third-party, local imports)
- **Error Handling**: Extend existing error handling patterns in `ErrorDisplay.jsx` and `EmptyState.jsx`
- **Type Safety**: Maintain consistent PropTypes or TypeScript usage with existing codebase

**Documentation Standards**: 
- **Component Documentation**: Follow existing JSDoc patterns for component props and functionality
- **API Documentation**: Extend existing API documentation with campus-aware endpoint specifications
- **README Updates**: Update main README.md with multi-campus setup and configuration instructions
- **Architecture Documentation**: Update existing architecture docs with multi-campus implementation details

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: 
- **Vite Configuration**: No changes required to existing Vite build process for frontend changes
- **Environment Variables**: Add campus-related configuration variables for API endpoints and feature flags
- **Django Build**: Integrate campus features into standard Django collectstatic and migration processes
- **Asset Management**: Ensure campus-specific assets (if any) integrate with existing asset pipeline

**Deployment Strategy**: 
- **Feature Flags**: Implement campus features behind feature flags for gradual rollout
- **Database Migrations**: Carefully planned schema migrations with rollback capabilities
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Support for zero-downtime deployment of multi-campus features
- **Configuration Management**: Campus settings managed through Django admin and environment configuration

**Monitoring and Logging**: 
- **Campus Context Logging**: Add campus ID to all relevant log entries for debugging and analytics
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track query performance for campus-aware database operations
- **Error Tracking**: Extend existing error tracking with campus context for better debugging
- **User Analytics**: Add campus-specific user behavior tracking and analytics

**Configuration Management**: 
- **Django Settings**: Campus features configured through Django settings with environment variable overrides
- **Feature Toggles**: Database-driven feature flags for campus functionality per deployment environment
- **Campus Configuration**: Admin interface for campus-specific settings and branding
- **API Configuration**: Campus-aware API rate limiting and access control configuration

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- **Database Performance**: Multi-campus queries may impact performance; mitigated through proper indexing and query optimization
- **Data Migration Complexity**: Risk of data loss during campus schema migration; mitigated through comprehensive backup and testing strategy
- **Authentication Complexity**: Campus-aware auth may introduce security vulnerabilities; mitigated through thorough security testing and audit

**Integration Risks**: 
- **API Compatibility**: Changes may break existing integrations; mitigated through API versioning and backward compatibility testing
- **Frontend Compatibility**: Campus features may conflict with existing UI; mitigated through feature flags and incremental rollout
- **Third-party Integration**: Mapbox and other services need campus context; mitigated through service abstraction layers

**Deployment Risks**: 
- **Migration Failures**: Database migration failures could cause downtime; mitigated through migration testing and rollback procedures
- **Feature Flag Failures**: Incorrect feature flag configuration could expose incomplete features; mitigated through staging environment testing
- **Performance Degradation**: Campus features may slow existing functionality; mitigated through performance testing and monitoring

**Mitigation Strategies**: 
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Multi-environment testing with automated test suites covering campus scenarios
- **Gradual Rollout**: Feature flag-controlled rollout allowing quick rollback if issues arise
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Real-time monitoring of performance metrics and error rates during rollout
- **Documentation and Training**: Clear rollback procedures and team training on campus feature management
