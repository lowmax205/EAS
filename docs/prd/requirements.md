# Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Campus Management:**
- **FR1:** The system shall allow super-administrators to create, configure, and manage multiple university campuses with unique identifiers, names, and configuration settings
- **FR2:** Each campus shall maintain complete data isolation with no cross-campus data visibility except for authorized super-admin users
- **FR3:** Campus administrators shall be able to manage users, events, and settings only within their assigned campus scope

**Enhanced Authentication & Authorization:**
- **FR4:** The existing authentication system shall be extended to include campus assignment for all user accounts
- **FR5:** Role-based permissions shall be enhanced to include campus-specific scope, allowing campus admins, campus organizers, and campus students
- **FR6:** Super-admin role shall be introduced to manage multiple campuses and cross-campus operations

**Multi-Campus Event Management:**
- **FR7:** Event creation and management shall be restricted to the user's assigned campus with no cross-campus event visibility
- **FR8:** Existing event CRUD operations shall continue to function identically for single-campus users while supporting campus context for multi-campus deployments
- **FR9:** QR code generation and attendance tracking shall remain campus-specific with unique QR patterns per campus

**Enhanced Reporting & Analytics:**
- **FR10:** Campus-specific dashboards shall provide analytics isolated to each campus's events and users
- **FR11:** Super-admin dashboard shall provide cross-campus analytics and system-wide reporting capabilities
- **FR12:** Existing SNSU reporting functionality shall be preserved and enhanced with campus-aware filtering

**Data Migration & Compatibility:**
- **FR13:** All existing SNSU data shall be automatically migrated to the new multi-campus structure without data loss
- **FR14:** Current SNSU users shall experience no workflow disruption during and after the multi-campus enhancement

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance & Scalability:**
- **NFR1:** System performance shall not degrade for existing single-campus operations, maintaining current response times
- **NFR2:** Database queries shall be optimized with proper indexing to handle multi-campus filtering without performance impact
- **NFR3:** The system shall scale to support minimum 10 campuses with 1000+ users each without architectural changes

**Security & Privacy:**
- **NFR4:** Campus data isolation shall be enforced at the database level with no possibility of cross-campus data leakage
- **NFR5:** Authentication and session management shall maintain existing security standards while supporting campus context
- **NFR6:** All campus-specific data access shall be logged and auditable

**Reliability & Maintenance:**
- **NFR7:** Multi-campus enhancement shall not introduce breaking changes to existing API endpoints used by current clients
- **NFR8:** System shall maintain 99.9% uptime during gradual multi-campus rollout with rollback capabilities
- **NFR9:** Code complexity shall be managed through consistent patterns and comprehensive testing to prevent maintenance degradation

### Compatibility Requirements

**API & Integration Compatibility:**
- **CR1:** All existing API endpoints shall remain functional with backward compatibility for current SNSU integrations
- **CR2:** Frontend components shall gracefully handle both single-campus and multi-campus modes through feature flags

**Database Schema Compatibility:**
- **CR3:** Existing database schema shall be extended through additive changes only, avoiding breaking modifications
- **CR4:** Current data relationships and foreign keys shall be preserved while adding campus context

**User Experience Compatibility:**
- **CR5:** Current SNSU user workflows shall remain identical unless explicitly opting into multi-campus features
- **CR6:** Existing UI components shall function without modification in single-campus mode
