# ðŸš¨ Risk Management

### Critical Risks
1. **Timeline Pressure** (14 days to defense)
   - **Mitigation**: Focus only on Tier 1 features, defer enhancements
   - **Contingency**: Prepare scaled-down demo if needed

2. **Technical Complexity** (Real-time updates, mobile integration)
   - **Mitigation**: Simple polling vs complex WebSockets
   - **Contingency**: Manual refresh option as backup

3. **Mobile Compatibility** (Camera, GPS access)
   - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement, fallback options
   - **Contingency**: Desktop demo with simulated mobile flow

### Medium Risks
1. **Performance Issues** (Large file uploads, concurrent users)
   - **Mitigation**: File compression, optimized queries, caching
   
2. **Third-party Dependencies** (Mapbox API, Cloudinary)
   - **Mitigation**: API key management, error handling, fallbacks
