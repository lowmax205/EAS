# Epic 1: EAS Multi-Campus Support Enhancement

### Epic Goal
Transform EAS from a single-campus Event Attendance System into a comprehensive multi-campus platform that enables multiple universities to operate independently while sharing the same system infrastructure, maintaining all existing functionality for current SNSU users while adding campus-specific data isolation, administrative controls, and reporting capabilities.

### Integration Requirements
- **Database Integration:** Campus entity integration with foreign key relationships across all major tables while preserving existing SNSU data
- **Authentication Integration:** Campus context added to existing Django authentication without breaking current user sessions
- **API Integration:** Backward-compatible API extensions with campus filtering while maintaining existing endpoint functionality
- **Frontend Integration:** Campus-aware components built upon existing React/shadcn/ui patterns without disrupting current user workflows
- **Performance Integration:** Campus features implemented with minimal impact on existing system performance through proper indexing and query optimization

### Story 1.1: Campus Data Model Foundation
As a **system administrator**,
I want **the database schema to support multiple campuses with proper data isolation**,
so that **the system can securely manage multiple university campuses without cross-campus data leakage**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Campus entity table created with unique identifiers, names, and configuration fields
2. All existing tables extended with campus foreign key relationships (nullable for backward compatibility)
3. SNSU data automatically assigned to default campus during migration with zero data loss
4. Database constraints enforce campus-based data isolation at the schema level
5. Migration scripts include comprehensive rollback procedures

#### Integration Verification
- **IV1:** All existing SNSU events, users, and attendance records remain accessible and functional
- **IV2:** Current API endpoints continue to return correct data for existing SNSU operations
- **IV3:** Database query performance remains within acceptable thresholds for existing operations

### Story 1.2: Campus-Aware Authentication & Authorization
As a **system administrator**,
I want **user authentication to include campus context and campus-specific permissions**,
so that **users can only access data and functionality within their assigned campus scope**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. User model extended with campus assignment (defaulting to SNSU for existing users)
2. Django permission system enhanced with campus-specific role definitions
3. Authentication middleware updated to include campus context in user sessions
4. Super-admin role implemented for cross-campus management capabilities
5. Existing SNSU user permissions preserved and automatically migrated

#### Integration Verification
- **IV1:** Current SNSU users can log in and access all existing functionality without changes
- **IV2:** Existing role-based permissions continue to function correctly for SNSU users
- **IV3:** Session management and security characteristics remain unchanged for existing users

### Story 1.3: Campus-Aware API Endpoints
As a **frontend developer**,
I want **API endpoints to support campus filtering while maintaining backward compatibility**,
so that **existing integrations continue working while new campus features are available**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. All existing API endpoints enhanced with optional campus filtering parameters
2. Campus-specific data isolation enforced at the API level through query filtering
3. API versioning implemented to support both legacy and campus-aware clients
4. Campus management API endpoints created for administrative functions
5. API documentation updated with campus parameter specifications

#### Integration Verification
- **IV1:** All existing API clients continue to function without modification
- **IV2:** API response formats remain identical for existing endpoint usage patterns
- **IV3:** API performance characteristics maintained for existing query patterns

### Story 1.4: Campus Selection UI Components
As a **campus administrator**,
I want **intuitive campus selection and management interfaces**,
so that **I can easily work within my campus context and manage campus-specific settings**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Campus selector component created using existing shadcn/ui patterns
2. Campus context provider implemented for React state management
3. Campus filter components added to event and user listing screens
4. Campus management interface created for super-admin users
5. All new components follow existing design system and responsive patterns

#### Integration Verification
- **IV1:** Existing UI components continue to function identically for SNSU users
- **IV2:** Current user workflows remain unchanged unless explicitly using new campus features
- **IV3:** Mobile responsiveness and accessibility standards maintained across all new components

### Story 1.5: Campus-Aware Event Management
As a **campus organizer**,
I want **event management to be restricted to my campus with complete isolation from other campuses**,
so that **I can manage campus events without seeing or affecting other campus operations**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Event creation forms enhanced with automatic campus assignment based on user context
2. Event listing screens filtered by user's campus assignment
3. QR code generation includes campus-specific encoding for attendance isolation
4. Event analytics and reporting scoped to campus-specific data only
5. Existing SNSU event functionality preserved and enhanced with campus context

#### Integration Verification
- **IV1:** All existing SNSU events remain accessible and manageable by current users
- **IV2:** Current event creation and management workflows function identically for SNSU users
- **IV3:** QR code scanning and attendance tracking performance maintained for existing events

### Story 1.6: Campus-Specific Reporting & Analytics
As a **campus administrator**,
I want **comprehensive analytics and reporting for my campus operations**,
so that **I can make data-driven decisions about campus event management and attendance tracking**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard analytics scoped to campus-specific data with clear campus context indicators
2. Campus-specific reporting interfaces with export capabilities
3. Super-admin cross-campus analytics dashboard for system-wide insights
4. Performance metrics and attendance analytics filtered by campus context
5. Existing SNSU reporting functionality enhanced rather than replaced

#### Integration Verification
- **IV1:** Current SNSU analytics and reporting continue to function with identical data and insights
- **IV2:** Dashboard performance remains consistent for existing single-campus operations
- **IV3:** Data export and reporting formats maintain compatibility with existing processes

### Story 1.7: Multi-Campus System Administration
As a **super administrator**,
I want **comprehensive tools to manage multiple campuses and monitor system-wide operations**,
so that **I can efficiently administer the multi-campus system while maintaining operational excellence**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Campus CRUD operations interface with configuration management capabilities
2. Cross-campus user management with campus assignment and transfer capabilities
3. System-wide monitoring dashboard with campus-specific health indicators
4. Multi-campus configuration management with campus-specific customization options
5. Audit logging and compliance reporting across all campus operations

#### Integration Verification
- **IV1:** Single-campus administration functions remain available and unchanged
- **IV2:** System performance monitoring continues to provide accurate metrics for existing operations
- **IV3:** Administrative workflows for SNSU operations remain streamlined and efficient
