# User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The multi-campus enhancement will integrate seamlessly with the existing EAS design system:

**Design System Continuity:**
- **shadcn/ui Components:** All new campus-related UI elements will use existing shadcn/ui component library for consistency
- **TailwindCSS Styling:** New campus selection and filtering components will follow established TailwindCSS utility patterns
- **Color Scheme & Branding:** Campus-specific UI elements will use the existing color palette with potential campus-specific accent colors
- **Layout Patterns:** New components will follow existing layout patterns established in `DashboardLayout.jsx` and existing page structures

**Component Architecture Integration:**
- **Existing Pattern Reuse:** Campus selection dropdowns and filters will extend existing `FilterComponent.jsx` patterns
- **Form Integration:** Campus management forms will use established form components from the `/components/forms/` directory
- **Data Table Enhancement:** Campus-aware data tables will build upon existing `DataTable.jsx` component
- **Navigation Enhancement:** Campus context will be integrated into existing navigation without disrupting current user flows

### Modified/New Screens and Views

**Enhanced Existing Screens:**
- **Dashboard:** Add campus selector and campus-specific analytics display
- **Event Management:** Add campus context to event creation and listing
- **User Management:** Include campus assignment in user profiles and admin screens
- **Reports/Analytics:** Add campus filtering and cross-campus reporting options

**New Screens/Views:**
- **Campus Management (Super Admin):** Complete CRUD interface for campus management
- **Campus Configuration:** Campus-specific settings and branding configuration
- **Multi-Campus Analytics Dashboard:** Cross-campus reporting and analytics
- **Campus User Assignment:** Interface for assigning users to campuses

- **UC5:** Form validation and submission patterns for campus management shall match existing form behavior
- **UC6:** Data table interactions for campus-aware listings shall maintain existing sorting, filtering, and pagination patterns

**Responsive Design:**
