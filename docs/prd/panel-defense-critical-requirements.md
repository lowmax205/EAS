# PRD: Panel Defense Critical Requirements

## 1. Executive Summary

**Project**: EAS Panel Defense Compliance Features  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: In Development  
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Academic Requirement)  
**Timeline**: 3 Weeks  

### Problem Statement
During the thesis defense at SNSU, the academic panel (Mr. Renz M. Buctuan, MIT) identified critical missing features that must be implemented for academic approval. While the current EAS system has excellent core functionality, it lacks specific user experience enhancements that the panel considers essential for a complete attendance management solution.

### Success Metrics
- 100% compliance with panel requirements
- Upload confirmation within 2 seconds
- Location permission approval rate >95%
- Auto-login success rate >98%
- Official report generation without errors
- Academic panel approval for thesis defense

## 2. Product Requirements

### Epic 1: Immediate Upload Feedback System

**User Story**: As a student taking attendance, I want immediate confirmation that my photo uploaded successfully so I know my attendance was recorded.

**Current State**: 
- Photos are captured and stored
- No immediate feedback to users
- Students uncertain if upload succeeded

**Required State**:
- Real-time upload progress indicator
- Success/failure confirmation messages
- Retry mechanism for failed uploads
- Visual feedback during entire upload process

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Upload progress bar shows 0-100% completion
- [ ] Success message displays within 2 seconds of completion
- [ ] Error messages provide clear retry options
- [ ] Progress indicator visible on all screen sizes
- [ ] Upload status persists until user acknowledges

### Epic 2: Location Permission Flow

**User Story**: As a student scanning a QR code, I want the system to explicitly ask for location permission so I understand why location access is needed.

**Current State**:
- GPS location requested automatically
- No explanation of why location is needed
- Users confused about location requirements

**Required State**:
- Explicit permission dialog after QR scan
- Clear explanation of location requirement
- Graceful handling of permission denial
- Alternative options if location denied

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Permission dialog appears after successful QR scan
- [ ] Dialog explains location is needed for attendance verification
- [ ] "Allow" and "Deny" options clearly presented
- [ ] If denied, offer manual location entry option
- [ ] Location accuracy displayed to user (within X meters)

### Epic 3: Auto-Login Authentication Flow

**User Story**: As a student accessing the attendance form, I want to be automatically prompted to log in if I'm not authenticated so I don't waste time filling out forms that won't save.

**Current State**:
- Users can access forms without authentication
- Data loss if not logged in
- Manual login process required

**Required State**:
- Automatic authentication check
- Login prompt before form access
- Seamless return to form after login
- User context preservation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Authentication status checked before form display
- [ ] Login dialog appears if user not authenticated
- [ ] Login process redirects back to original form
- [ ] User context (QR data, location) preserved during login
- [ ] Clear messaging about why login is required

### Epic 4: Form Pre-Population System

**User Story**: As a logged-in student, I want my name, course, and year automatically filled in the attendance form so I only need to add my photo and signature.

**Current State**:
- All form fields require manual entry
- User data available but not utilized
- Repetitive data entry process

**Required State**:
- Automatic form population from user profile
- Only photo and signature require manual input
- Data validation and confirmation
- Edit capability for incorrect data

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Student name auto-populated from profile
- [ ] Course information automatically filled
- [ ] Year level pre-selected from user data
- [ ] Only photo capture and signature remain manual
- [ ] Pre-filled data is editable if incorrect
- [ ] Form submission validates all auto-filled data

### Epic 5: Official SNSU Report Generation

**User Story**: As an event organizer, I want to download attendance reports in SNSU's official format with student photos so I can submit proper documentation to the university.

**Current State**:
- Generic PDF/Excel export placeholders
- No SNSU branding or format
- Student photos not included in reports

**Required State**:
- Official SNSU letterhead and formatting
- Student photos integrated in report
- Professional layout and presentation
- Multiple export formats available

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Report includes SNSU official header and logo
- [ ] Student photos displayed in attendance table
- [ ] Signatures included in report layout
- [ ] Professional formatting with proper spacing
- [ ] Download available in PDF format
- [ ] Report includes event details and generation timestamp
