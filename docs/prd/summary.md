# Summary

This PRD provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming EAS into a multi-campus platform while maintaining the integrity and performance of the existing single-campus system. The sequential story structure minimizes risk to current operations while delivering comprehensive multi-campus capabilities through carefully planned incremental enhancements.

The enhancement preserves all existing SNSU functionality while providing the foundation for scalable, secure multi-tenant operations that can serve multiple universities with complete data isolation and operational independence.
