# Infrastructure and Deployment

### Deployment Architecture

#### **Multi-Campus Deployment Strategy**
The system will utilize a centralized deployment model with campus-aware data partitioning for optimal performance and management efficiency.

```yaml
Deployment Model:
  Type: "Centralized Multi-Tenant"
  Rationale: "Single codebase, shared infrastructure, campus-isolated data"
  
Architecture Components:
  Frontend: "Single React SPA with campus context routing"
  Backend: "Django application with campus-aware middleware"
  Database: "Single PostgreSQL instance with campus-based partitioning"
  Cache Layer: "Redis with campus-segmented cache keys"
  File Storage: "Campus-organized object storage structure"
```

#### **Infrastructure Components**

**Web Application Tier:**
```yaml

  Platform: "Static hosting (Netlify/Vercel recommended)"
  Build Process: "Vite production build with campus environment variables"
  CDN Strategy: "Global CDN with campus-specific asset optimization"
  Performance: "Campus-aware code splitting and lazy loading"

Backend Services:
  Platform: "Container orchestration (Docker + Kubernetes recommended)"

  Backup Strategy: "Campus-aware backup scheduling and retention"

Partition Strategy:
  Users Table: "PARTITION BY LIST (campus_id)"
  Events Table: "PARTITION BY LIST (campus_id)" 
  Attendance Table: "PARTITION BY RANGE (date) SUBPARTITION BY LIST (campus_id)"
  Benefits: "Improved query performance, campus-isolated maintenance"
```

**Caching and Performance:**
```yaml
Cache Architecture:
  Primary Cache: "Redis cluster with campus-aware key namespacing"

  API Response Caching: "Campus-specific response caching patterns"
```

### Environment Configuration

#### **Campus-Aware Environment Variables**
```typescript
interface CampusEnvironmentConfig {
  // Campus identification
  CAMPUS_DEFAULT_ID: number; // Default campus for new users
  CAMPUS_ADMIN_ID: number;   // Main administrative campus
  
  // Campus-specific features
  ENABLE_CROSS_CAMPUS_EVENTS: boolean;
  ENABLE_CAMPUS_SWITCHING: boolean;
  CAMPUS_ISOLATION_STRICT: boolean;
  
  // Performance settings
  CAMPUS_CACHE_TTL: number;
  CAMPUS_QUERY_TIMEOUT: number;
  CAMPUS_MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS: number;
  
  // Campus-specific integrations
  MAPBOX_CAMPUS_COORDINATES: CampusCoordinates[];
  CAMPUS_SPECIFIC_SMTP_CONFIGS: CampusEmailConfig[];
}
```

#### **Configuration Management Strategy**
```yaml
Configuration Hierarchy:
  1: "Global application defaults"
  2: "Campus-specific overrides"
  3: "Environment-specific settings (dev/staging/prod)"
  4: "Runtime feature flags"

Campus Configuration Structure:
  global:
    database_url: "${DATABASE_URL}"
    redis_url: "${REDIS_URL}"
    default_campus_id: 1
  
  campus_overrides:
    campus_1: # Main Campus
      email_domain: "@snsu.edu.ph"
      timezone: "Asia/Manila"
      max_event_capacity: 1000
    
    campus_2: # Malimono Campus  
      email_domain: "@malimono.snsu.edu.ph"
      timezone: "Asia/Manila"
      max_event_capacity: 500
```

### Security Architecture

#### **Campus-Based Security Model**
```yaml
Security Layers:
  1: "Application-level campus authorization"
  2: "Database-level row-level security (RLS)"
  3: "API-level campus parameter validation"
  4: "UI-level campus context enforcement"

Row-Level Security Implementation:
  Policy: "Users can only access data from their assigned campus"
  Admin Override: "Admin roles bypass RLS for cross-campus operations"
  Audit Trail: "All cross-campus access logged for compliance"
```

#### **Security Configuration**
```sql
-- PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for campus isolation
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE attendance ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Campus access policy
CREATE POLICY campus_access_policy ON users
  FOR ALL TO authenticated_user
  USING (
    campus_id = current_setting('app.current_user_campus_id')::int
    OR 
    current_setting('app.current_user_role') IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
  );

-- Event campus isolation policy
CREATE POLICY event_campus_policy ON events
  FOR ALL TO authenticated_user  
  USING (
    campus_id = current_setting('app.current_user_campus_id')::int
    OR 
    (is_multi_campus = true AND current_setting('app.current_user_role') = 'admin')
  );
```

### Monitoring and Observability

#### **Campus-Aware Monitoring Strategy**
```yaml
Metrics Collection:
  Application Metrics:
    - "Campus-specific user activity rates"
    - "Campus-based event creation patterns" 
    - "Cross-campus access frequency"
    - "Campus-isolated performance metrics"
  
  Infrastructure Metrics:
    - "Campus-segmented database query performance"
    - "Campus cache hit rates and memory usage"
    - "Campus-specific API response times"
    - "Campus data storage utilization"

Alerting Strategy:
  Campus-Specific Alerts:
    - "Campus database partition performance degradation"
    - "Campus-specific error rate spikes"
    - "Campus data isolation policy violations" 
    - "Campus-based capacity threshold breaches"
```

#### **Logging and Audit Trail**
```typescript
interface CampusAuditLog {
  timestamp: Date;
  user_id: number;
  user_campus_id: number;
  action: string;
  resource_type: string;
  resource_id: number;
  resource_campus_id: number;
  cross_campus_access: boolean;
  authorized: boolean;
  ip_address: string;
  user_agent: string;
}

// Campus audit logging middleware
const campusAuditMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const auditData = {
    user_campus_id: req.user.campusId,
    resource_campus_id: extractCampusFromRequest(req),
    cross_campus_access: req.user.campusId !== extractCampusFromRequest(req),
    action: `${req.method} ${req.path}`,
    // ... other audit fields
  };
  
  auditLogger.log(auditData);
  next();
};
```

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

#### **Campus-Aware Backup Strategy**
```yaml
Backup Architecture:
  Strategy: "Campus-segmented backup with cross-campus replication"
  Frequency: "Daily incremental, weekly full backups per campus"
  Retention: "30-day retention with campus-specific archival policies"
  
Campus Backup Schedule:
  Main Campus (Primary): "Full backup daily at 2 AM"
  Regional Campuses: "Full backup daily at 3 AM"
  Cross-Campus Sync: "Hourly incremental sync for disaster recovery"
  
Recovery Procedures:
  Campus-Specific Recovery: "Individual campus data restoration"
  Full System Recovery: "Complete multi-campus restoration procedure"
  Point-in-Time Recovery: "Campus-aware PITR with data consistency checks"
```

#### **Disaster Recovery Plan**
```yaml
Recovery Time Objectives (RTO):
  Critical Services: "< 1 hour"
  Campus-Specific Data: "< 2 hours"
  Full Multi-Campus Restoration: "< 4 hours"

Recovery Point Objectives (RPO):
  Transaction Data: "< 15 minutes"
  Campus Configuration: "< 1 hour"
  Audit Logs: "< 5 minutes"

Failover Strategy:
  Primary Campus Failure: "Automatic failover to designated backup campus"
  Regional Campus Failure: "Route to main campus with campus context preserved"
  Complete System Failure: "Multi-campus restoration from geographic backups"
```

### Scalability Planning

#### **Campus Growth Strategy**
```yaml
Horizontal Scaling Plan:
  New Campus Addition:
    - "Automated campus provisioning workflow"
    - "Campus-specific configuration deployment"
    - "Data partition creation and indexing"
    - "Campus-aware load balancer configuration"

  Campus Load Distribution:
    - "Campus-aware request routing"
    - "Campus-specific resource allocation"
    - "Campus-based auto-scaling triggers"
    - "Cross-campus load balancing for peak events"

Performance Scalability:
  Database Scaling: "Campus-based sharding strategy ready"
  Application Scaling: "Campus-aware microservices migration path"
  Cache Scaling: "Campus-distributed cache clusters"
  Storage Scaling: "Campus-partitioned object storage growth"
```

#### **Capacity Planning**
```yaml
Campus Capacity Metrics:
  User Capacity per Campus:
    Main Campus: "2000 concurrent users"
    Regional Campuses: "500 concurrent users each"
    Peak Load Factor: "3x normal capacity during events"
  
  Data Growth Projections:
    User Data: "20% annual growth per campus"
    Event Data: "50% growth during academic peak periods"
    Attendance Records: "High volume, 6-month retention active"
  
  Infrastructure Scaling Triggers:
    CPU Utilization: "> 70% for 5 minutes"
    Memory Usage: "> 80% for 3 minutes"  
    Database Connections: "> 80% of pool capacity"
    Cache Hit Rate: "< 85% for sustained periods"
```

**This infrastructure and deployment strategy provides a robust, scalable foundation for multi-campus operations while maintaining operational efficiency and campus data isolation. The architecture supports both current needs and future growth requirements.**
