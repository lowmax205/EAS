### Technology Alignment Strategy

**No New Technology Additions Required** - The enhancement leverages existing technology stack effectively:

- **React Ecosystem:** Campus context fits naturally into existing React patterns
- **Component Architecture:** shadcn/ui components extended with campus props
- **Data Flow:** Campus context flows through existing service â†’ component architecture
- **Backend Readiness:** Planned Django backend ideal for multi-tenant campus isolation
