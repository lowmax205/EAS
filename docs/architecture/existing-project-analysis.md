# Existing Project Analysis

### Current Project State
- **Primary Purpose:** Event Attendance System for Surigao del Norte State University with QR-based attendance tracking, event management, and role-based access control
- **Current Tech Stack:** React 18 + Vite frontend, Django backend (planned), mock data services for development
- **Architecture Style:** Modern SPA with service layer pattern, component-based React architecture with shadcn/ui design system
- **Deployment Method:** Frontend via Vite build system, backend deployment pending Django implementation

### Available Documentation
- Epic documents for multi-campus support with detailed stories and compatibility requirements
- Frontend brownfield architecture document exists
- README.md with comprehensive project structure and requirements
- Mock data structures showing single-campus design with `"college": "main-campus"` pattern

### Identified Constraints
- Mock data services must be maintained during Django backend development
- Single-campus user records in current mock data need campus assignment migration
- Performance optimization required for campus-based filtering
- Existing API contracts must remain unchanged for backward compatibility
- Component patterns must be preserved while adding campus context

### Critical Discovery - Existing Multi-Campus Foundation
**GAME CHANGER:** The `mockUniversity.json` reveals sophisticated multi-campus data model already exists:

- **4 Campuses:** Main Campus, Malimono Campus, Del Carmen Campus, Mainit Campus
- **11 Departments:** Distributed across campuses with unique IDs (1-11)
- **49 Courses:** Campus-specific course offerings with detailed program information
- **Hierarchical Structure:** University → Campus → Department → Course with proper isolation boundaries

**Validation Confirmed:** User confirmed this multi-campus structure is the intended target state, significantly reducing implementation complexity.
