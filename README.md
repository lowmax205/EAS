Conventional methods of monitoring attendance at school events are unreliable, error-prone, and easily manipulated. To prevent attendance fraud, reduce administrative burden, lower implementation costs, and enable real-time attendance monitoring, institutions require a reliable and automated solution. To enhance the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of attendance logging at SNSU and similar institutions, this research proposes to develop a mobile web-based event attendance tracking system.

## üéØ General Objectives

This study aims to develop a system that improves the accuracy, security, and convenience of tracking event attendance. The system utilizes GPS tracking along with QR code scanning and biometric verification to provide a safe and reliable mechanism for recording attendance at SNSU school events.

## üìã Specific Objectives

Specifically, this system aimed to:

1. **Develop an Event Attendance Management System** based on Django framework
2. **Implement QR Code-Based Attendance Tracking** with encrypted security
3. **Integrate Location and Visual Verification Features** for fraud prevention
4. **Provide Automated Reporting and Data Analytics** for comprehensive insights

## üîç Scope and Limitations
